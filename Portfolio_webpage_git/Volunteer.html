                  After finishing high school, I went to Malawi for a year as a volunteer development aid worker via a German federal government-funded program. As a volunteer teacher, I taught aspiring primary school teachers information systems. Later, I developed crucial systems that supported a local NGO with its commercial and fundraising activities. During both postings, I had the opportunity to meet amazing people and intensely experience a very different culture. In my free time, I travelled through Malawi, Zambia, South Africa, and Tanzania with local public transport, learning to appreciate and explore different cultures. I enjoyed my work and travels during that time and met so many other people I would have never met otherwise.

                    I've tried numerous hobbies over the years - among others equestrian, rugby and field hockey -, but none have resonated with me as much as boxing. It's the one activity that I've found genuinely enjoyable – a perfect blend of exhilaration and discipline. What makes boxing so engaging is that it engages the body and the mind at the same time. Whilst doing boxing drills one needs to be extremely focused, otherwise you might get punched in the face accidentally. Despite a common misconception it's not merely about strength; the technical mastery required for each movement, from the precise footwork to the execution of each punch, offers a rich, rewarding complexity.
                    <br>
                    Furthermore, boxing offers a great workout that’s both challenging and enjoyable, improving fitness while providing a fun experience. That is the main reason why it stuck with me over several years. This balance of enjoyment and physical rigor is what has solidified boxing as a hobby that I'm passionate about and committed to continuing.
