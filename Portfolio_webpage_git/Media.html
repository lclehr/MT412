                <p>Mike Vedomske, Senior Data Scientist at Nike with a PhD in Systems and Information Engineering, is a guest on this podcast episode. He discusses various facets of data science and its application. This podcast is especially interesting as Mike shares deep insights about how data science can be used in different industries. He covers business applications from customer segmentation to fraud detection, thus showing the broad span of the work done by data scientists.</p>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/3nVxouK544LBvkGHn4xjTx?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>In this episode Nick Singh, a career coach and former growth engineer at facebook, shares his expertise in building a strong portfolio and standing out to recruiters. Apart from talking about his work at facebook, Singh offers valuable insights into the data science industry and its recruiting practices. He especially points at the importance of having a good portfolio to show, when trying to secure a job at a FAANG company.</p>

                <p>Naked data science is one of the leading data science podcasts on spotify. The episode discusses the common misconception that data science always involves machine learning and clarifies that many data-intensive problems do not require ML techniques, even in major tech firms like FAANG. Nima, a former Machine Learning researcher, shares his transition to becoming a problem-solver using data science, offering tips for others to make a similar shift. This podcast is very interesting as it addresses a very common missconception. </p>

                >
                <p>Kubicle is a digital learning platform build around data education. It was instrumental in my journey of learning data analytics. Besides Python courses it offers also other programming languages and excel courses.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div>
              <h3>Data Camp</h3>
              <a
                  href="https://www.datacamp.com/category/data-analysis"

                  >Link to Site</a
                >
                <p>Data Camp is a similar resource as kubicle but with significantly more content and a wider range of tools. This is especially useful for more advanced learners who want to get exposed to additional tools and more advanced problems. This tool is also very well recognized in a variety of industries making it particularly useful to showcase ones skills.</p>

              <h3>Mimo</h3>
              <a
                  href="https://mimo.org/"

                  >Link to Site</a
                >  
                <p>Mimo is a great tool for beginners that want to get into coding. It works with a high degree for gamification and is perfect for self study. However, I would not recommend it for people who already have some degree of coding knowledge, as it does not go in depth as far as Data Camp or Kubicle.</p>
