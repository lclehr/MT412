                  </header>
                  <p>
                    The Machine Learning Mastery article explains the concepts of batches and epochs in the context of training neural networks with stochastic gradient descent. It clarifies that a batch refers to the number of samples processed before the model is updated, whereas an epoch is the number of complete passes through the entire training dataset. This article helped me to understand how models learn and was instrumental whilst building my first deep learning algorithm.

              <h3>Medium - Roadmap to Learn Python for Data Science</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              Hrishikesh Shelar outlines a comprehensive roadmap for learning Python for data science. This roadmap is aimed at complete beginners who want to get started with data science but dont know how exactly. The guide covers initial setup using Jupyter Notebook, progresses through basic to advanced Python concepts—including data types, control structures, and object-oriented programming—and suggests methods for practical learning and assessment through platforms like HackerRank. It is a great resource for anyone who is just starting out and needs a point in the right direction.
